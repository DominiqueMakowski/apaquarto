# Version 3.1.0 (2024-09-02)

- The `floatsintext` option now works in docx and html. Setting it to `true`, intermingles text, figures, and tables. Setting it to `false` moves all figures and tables to the end of the document.

# Version 3.0.0 (2024-01-20)

The main goal for version 3 was to do everything with lua filters instead of R. It was quite a journey, but apaquarto is now completely independent of R, which should help folks working with other languages.

## Breaking changes

* The the `apafg-` and `apatb-` prefixes are no longer used for figures and tables. Use the standard Quarto prefixes (`fig-` and `tbl-`), as well as the standard quarto referencing syntax (e.g,. `@fig-myplot` will reference the `fig-myplot` chunk.). 
*  The include statement below the metadata is no longer used and must be deleted. An informative error will provide instruction if the include statement remains. 

## Improvements

- The title page and abstract page are now processed using lua filters instead of R.
- The .docx running header is set with a lua filter and a docx field that draws from the .docx metadata. 
- The officer package is no longer required to create a new reference document every time the document is rendered.
- The jou (journal) mode in .pdf is better supported.

# Version 2.0.0 (2023-11-10)

- Many small fixes
- Support for .html and .pdf became more solid.
- CReditT taxonomy added for author roles.

# Version 1.0.0 (2023-03-05)

- Initial release
- Basic functions worked, but relied on many hacks that I always intended to fix. 
- Mostly just for .docx, but .html and .pdf supported to some degree.
